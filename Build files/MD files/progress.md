# progress.md — Build state

> **Read this first in every session.** It is the only handoff between Claude Code sessions.
> Update it whenever a phase completes, and whenever a session ends mid-phase.

**Last updated:** 23 September 2026 (architecture revised: raw returns to Drive via an in-app upload wrapper)
**Updated by:** Architect (pre-build setup)
**Current phase:** Phase 0 — not started
**Next action:** Confirm the Google Workspace tier is Business Standard or above, then run Phase 0

## Session log

Newest entries at the top. One entry per session.

### 23 Sep 2026 — Pre-build setup
**Phase:** Setup (no phase started)
**Done:** Architecture deep dive completed. All decisions locked (see `context.md`). Five static HTML prototypes built and signed off by the client: `admin.html`, `brand-manager.html`, `editor.html`, `cameraman.html`, `login.html` + `theme.css`. These are **design references only** — they are not application code and sit in `ui-prototypes/`, outside the Next.js app. Project docs written.
**Not done:** No Next.js app exists yet. No backend, no schema, no components.
**Deviations:** Cameraman UI was rebuilt calendar-first after the initial list-based version was rejected.
**Carried forward:** Workspace tier needs confirming before Phase 0.

## Open blockers

| # | Blocker | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Confirm the purchased Google Workspace plan is Business Standard (₹864/user/mo) or above — Starter has no Shared Drives and a service account cannot write anywhere else | Ashmeet | 🔴 Open |
| 2 | Grant editors read access to the Shared Drive — cameramen need no Google access at all, editors do | Ashmeet | 🔴 Open |
| 3 | Create the Backblaze B2 bucket and application keys | RapidArc | 🔴 Open |

## Decisions made mid-build

Anything decided during a session that isn't already in `context.md` or `techstack.md` goes here, then gets promoted into those files.

| Date | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 23 Sep 2026 | Raw returns to Google Drive, uploaded via an in-app wrapper rather than Drive's UI or a desk agent | The server opens a Drive resumable session as the service account and hands the browser only the session URI; chunks go browser to Google directly with no Google credentials on the client. Sessions last a week, so progress survives a closed tab — the user re-picks the same file and continues from Google's byte count. Cameramen need no Google access at all; editors need Shared Drive read. B2 keeps cuts, voice notes and library assets, because Drive cannot give an expiring per-view link or an instrumentable player for timestamped review. Supersedes the B2-only decision below. |
| 23 Sep 2026 | ~~Dropped Google Drive; all media on Backblaze B2~~ (superseded same day) | Footage originates on camera cards that reach an office machine, not on phones — so Drive's mobile app solved a problem this agency does not have, while importing a service-account quota trap, a Workspace tier requirement, a 2TB ceiling and polling-based status sync. B2 Event Notifications (now GA) replace polling with signed webhooks. Google OAuth is retained for sign-in only. |

## Not yet designed

- RapidArc platform console (Phase 11)

## How to update this file

At the end of every session, whether the phase finished or not:

1. Update the header block — date, current phase, next action.
2. Update the phase status table.
3. Add a session log entry at the top with: what was done, what was not, any deviation from the phase file, anything carried forward.
4. Add or resolve blockers.
5. Record any new decision in the decisions table.

Be specific. "Worked on Phase 3" is useless to the next session. "Content items CRUD and status transitions done; calendar view renders but the list-view toggle is unwired" is what the next session needs.
